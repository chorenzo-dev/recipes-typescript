## Goal

Configure TypeScript with the strictest compiler options to catch errors early and enforce best practices.

## Investigation

1. **Locate TypeScript configuration**
   - Check for tsconfig.json in the project root
   - Look for TypeScript configuration in package.json
   - Identify any existing compiler options that may conflict

2. **Check current TypeScript setup**
   - Verify TypeScript is installed as a dependency
   - Check if any build tools or frameworks override TypeScript settings
   - Identify source directories and file patterns covered by TypeScript

3. **Assess compatibility requirements**
   - Check if the project uses React, Node.js, or other frameworks
   - Identify any legacy code that might need gradual migration
   - Review existing type definitions and declaration files

## Expected Output

- strict-typescript-config.configured: Boolean indicating if strict TypeScript configuration is applied
- strict-typescript-config.options_enabled: String listing which strict options were enabled
